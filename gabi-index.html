        <p>These asphalt veins that connect cities, communities and commerce are generally regarded as a benchmark standard of judging proper and efficient governance. 
            This is viewed within the now, the currently occuring, and regards past urban planning structures as removed. I often see a stream of social media backed protest performances that criticize and denounce the ANC for this deterioration and lack of maintenance, citing poor administrative production processes and corruption.
            Disclaimer: I will not be delving into the ability of a political party nor it's lack of accountability within these municipal duties. This research seeks to understand the relation of these tar scars to previous colonial systems that implemented their being and how this is experienced, and subsequently commented on, by community members within the majority and minority group in the present.
            </p>
        <br>
            <p>One cannot discuss infrastructure within the South African context without taking its Apartheid past into consideration.
            There is, to this day, a continuous loop of a regurgitating <a href="https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/group-areas-act-1950#:~:text=The%20Group%20Areas%20Act%20was,Relations%2C%201950%3A%2026).">Group Areas Act</a> of prohibited movement. Now conveniently referred to as a case of classism in place of racism, this reference disregards how this decade-long exclusionist restructuring was devised within a white supremacist framework. 
            These roads are intrinsically linked to a time period that was centered on the oppression of the majority and enforcing racial segregation.

<h2 id="p-heading-1">Pothole as Place of Performance</h2>
<h3 id="p-heading-2">There are countless videos of disgruntled citizens jumping into the water, bathing, placing crocodiles into the potholes as means of displaying their displeasure. 
    Some research (limited to social platforms: Reddit, 9gag, TikTok, Instagram, Youtube) has shown that this specific form of protest performance is most often seen in other previously colonized countries such as Thailand, India, Colombia, Cameroon, Madagascar, Haiti, etc.
    <br>
    This correlates with the index of countries' that have the <a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/roads_quality/"> worst road infrastructures in the world.</a>
    <br>
    The Titanic Pothole meme is a keeper = reminder: (as discussed in class review) to keep a sense of humour in navigating the discomfort, a strong characteristic of South African culture.

<h2 id="m-heading-1">Materiality : Production</h2>
<h3 id="m-heading-2"> November 15th, I'm currently experiencing difficulty with trying to narrow down the actual physicality of the project. It feels as if there's a hundred ideas swirling around and just reading one essay or looking at one series of artworks could result in a further hundred ideas being added.
    <br>
    I'm leaning towards the idea of merging: collaboration, film, installation, actual asphalt. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The project was initially inspired by a piece of tar I found just off a pothole in the Free State as well as protest videos I saw on Instagram / TikTok with South African Afrikaans men spraypainting the potholes - outlining them - and tagging ANC, basically a call to the government to fix the states of the roads / pay more attention to general municipal services.
    Recalling this initial focus = tangibility of tar + recorded video of protest = these two elements should feature in some form.

            I've re-connected with a school friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sglJF556MHA">Rakgadi Nonki</a>, whose work I greatly admire. She describes herself as a poet, performance artist and healer. With a specific focus on the power of storytelling,
            she utilizes words and performance in bringing about change, particularly with her ongoing work which involves youth and emotional intelligence tools in navigating the future.
            <br>
            As she also has a direct connection to the Free State and grew up within the Apartheid to democracy switch, her power in storytelling would add to the narrative and dissection of the imagery presented on screen.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've decided to scrap the element of a performance piece as it's a very delicate line to work with in terms of bodily representations and the weightiness that both the subject and sites hold.
            I will rather work on combining footage of the actual pothole sites & archival blueprints and photography with the narration of Rakgadi - whether it be more essayic or poetic, yet to be determined - over the imagery.

            <p>'Chapter Q: Dem Short-Short Falls' is a memorial work that revisits the site of the 1992 Biljmer Airplane Crash, known as the Bijlmerramp, where a cargo plane that was traveling from the USA to Israel (occupied Palestine) crashed into a high-rise apartment building, affecting a community of foreign nationals living in Amsterdam, most of whom originated from or had links to Suriname, a former Dutch Colony. Taking its cue from the 1994 Nelson Mandela book title 'The Long Walk to Freedom', 'Chapter Q: Dem Short-Short-Falls' is the "Question-Chapter" of the history book. The site of the performance holds two points of significance; the memorial for the victims of Bijlmerramp of 1992 and the Bijlmermeer park which was renamed, in 2014, as the Nelson Mandela park. The performance and resulting two-channel video installation serves as a commemoration of the unrecorded trauma and loss at the point of impact of the crash, while also physically tracing slippages and exposing the gaps in how the ideals of 'freedom in a post-colonial society' continues to remain murky.</p>

<h2 id="november-heading-1">End of November '23: Progress Update</h2>
<h3 id="november-heading-2"> 28th November, I've researched Shuji Terayama extensively for a side-project and one of his works sticks out as a form of influence for TAR.
    <br>
    Terayama collaborated with poet Shuntaro Tanikawa on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyK9QITsNsw">Video Letter (1983)</a>, a series of six short films that experiments with poetry, the then-novel video medium, performance and the archive.
    Created six months before Terayama's death, the film series captures his obsession with the ephemeral and existential. A nostalgic look at both his physical being and the environment's - particularly Japan - hold on shaping experience.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm looking into combining this use of recent footage, the staged and the archival in exploring a personal and general outlook on this infrastructure that shapes the daily lives of South Africans and how this stands as a symbol for both ease of movement and for personal memory.
    Growing up within South Africa, there was always a sense of shoving difficult discussions related to history, racism and privilege under the rug. This is probably relatable to plenty a culture and country. Employed as a way of moving forward, this foundation only acts as a temporary space of stability before the cracks begin to surface.
    The use of video and narration provides a toolset to explore these themes through the extended use of language and memory tracing as opposed to a more reductive one-dimensional format.
