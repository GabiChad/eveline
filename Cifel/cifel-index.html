        Open-mindedness is more than an abstract concept. 
        <br>
        It's a deeply continuous process.
        <br> 
        It's about being receptive to new realities, experiences, and possibilities. It is also a cultural shared space that has no form or shape, area or volume. This ambiguous space behaves as a liminal mental environment in the forms of realizations, conflicts, individual and collective efforts and exchanges.
