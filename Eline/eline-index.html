        <p>Last year, I was still a student at St.-Joost in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, studying Fine-Arts.
            <br>
            <br>"I am part of an entity, less myself, a greater part of you. Yet, that realization swiftly fades away. The rejected institution is no longer my foundation but the path to what comes next. Where is the balance between ethics and aesthetics? There lies the marble of the stair. I have felt myself bricked in the new plans. It’s broken, chiseled, and framed. The hierarchy is restored comme il faut. So far, my paradoxical absurdity of existence as student number 2142911."

             I sense the presence of (power) structures in which I am entwined. I continuously navigate them. They are invisible but occasionally overwhelmingly palpable. They are elusive, causing my world to feel estranged. This constant awareness accompanies me, shaping my reactions to my environment. I try to visualize the ambiguous relationship between myself, my critical perspective, and the invisible yet palpable structures and systems. I delve into topics such as institutional criticism, the impact of technocratization within cultural policies, the role of activism in art, and my role as a female creator. Through the use of site-specific materials, I reference the context in which I exist. This resulted during the graduation exhibition at my previous academy in a multimedia installation comprising performance, video, and sculpture.

            This year, I am student number 0169774-24, pursuing the pre-master in socio-politics at St. Lucas in Antwerp. I chose this program because I believe it will help me further explore the position I currently occupy within my practice. My previous research emerged from the topics of technocratization and institutional critique, as the academy I was in at the time was transitioning to Creative Business Innovation. Now, I find myself in a different environment, no longer within that specific context. Through this pre-master program, I want to delve into more topics related to institutional criticism, the impact of technocratization within cultural policies, but most importantly, the position of a female creator. This platform will serve as my digitized studio where the process of my research into this inquiry will be visible.
